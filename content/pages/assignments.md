Essays
------

### Essay 1

Due one day before Ses #13

Select one of the propositions/questions offered by one of your classmates (or one of your own, for that matter, but in either case, one we didn't really "solve" in class). Use it as the point of origin of a five-page (1250 words) analytic essay on the relevant text (or, if it works, another text on the syllabus).

The links in [study materials]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/study-materials) will help you understand how to formulate an analytic thesis and probe a text analytically. Please, spare me the vague impressionism, the plot summary; stick to the hard, precise, focused attention to the nuts and bolts of a piece of writing.

### Essay 2

Due one day after Ses #25

Choose either _Cosmicomics_ or _The Periodic Table_ and write an essay that is 8-10 pages (2000-2500 words) in length. Focusing especially on one chapter in the book you choose and proceeding by way of close textual analysis, articulate what seems to you to be a primary thematic concern of the book, and show how the "science" deployed either deepens or obscures that theme.
